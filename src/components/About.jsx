        Your one stop shop to find and write authentic reviews from verified students that have attended a continuing education program.
        At RRBRP we believe that boot camps and short terms programs are positively distrupting Higher Education and will continue to do so. At RRBRP  we understand that
        continuing your education can be a large investment and often times one may feel better investing in a program after reading reviews on past student experiences. 
        We verify that students have graduated/attended a short term program based on our vetting process. We do not allow any ads from programs on our website to ensure there is no bias.
